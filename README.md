### About

This directory contains supplementary materials for the following publication:

Robitaille, 2017, *A modular set of synthetic spectral energy 
distributions for young stellar objects*

The models themselves are available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.166732)

To get started, take a look at [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/hyperion-rt/paper-2017-sed-models/blob/master/notebook/using_the_models.ipynb) to find out more about how to use the models.

### Requirements

The packages required to run the scripts in this directory are:

* Python 2.7 or 3.3 or later (http://www.python.org)
* Numpy 1.10 or later (http://www.numpy.org)
* Matplotlib 1.4 or later (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net)
* Astropy 1.0 or later (http://www.astropy.org)
* Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io)
* sedfitter 1.0 or later (http://sedfitter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Questions/Issues

For any questions or issues with using the models, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hyperion-rt/paper-2017-sed-models/issues/new) in this repository. For issues with using the [sedfitter](https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter) Python package, [open an issue](https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter/issues/new) in the repository for that package.

### Future plans

This repository will evolve over time. In particular, I will:

* Add the scripts to reproduce the results from the paper
* Add the scripts used to construct, run, and post-process the model grid
* Provide a link to the raw Hyperion output files, which can be used to extract the density and temperature structure, as well as the polarization information and SEDs split by component (e.g. scattered stellar flux, thermal dust emission, etc.)
